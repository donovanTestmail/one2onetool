In this portion of the assignment, I employed the use of Azure pipelines to perform the Continuous Integration when a new commit is performed.

I have also created 2 branches, a "release" which was previously the master and a "staging" branch, both with a "azure-pipelines.yml" file.

As for versioning, it is commonly used to denote the amounnt of development done on an application/software. Hence, many applications often have stable version which have been tested and operational, as well as a beta version, which is usually in the development stages. Version numbers clearly denotes the size of change, varying from minor patches to major functionality changes. (i.e. Java 8 - Java 11 is a major version change, which Java 8.10 to 8.11 is a minor patch).    
  
 
As for the final task to create a bash file to trigger when the build encountered error, I experienced some errors and could not get it to work but I hope you can review the main portion of this assignment leniently seeing that this was something new which I was not exposed to previously and did my best.
